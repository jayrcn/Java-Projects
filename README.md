# NGordNet Project
A project that builds a browser based tool for exploring the history of word usage in English texts. The Google Ngram dataset provides many terabytes of information about the historical frequencies of all observed words and phrases in English (or more precisely all observed ngrams). Google provides the Google Ngram Viewer on the web , allowing users to visualize the relative historical popularity of words and phrases. For example, the link above plots the relative popularity of the phrases “global warming” (a 2gram) and “to the moon” (a 3gram).
